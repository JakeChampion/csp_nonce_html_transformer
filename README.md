# `html-rewriter-wasm`

An implementation of
[HTMLRewriter](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/html-rewriter)
using a WebAssembly version of
[lol-html](https://github.com/cloudflare/lol-html/). This was primarily written
for [üî• Miniflare](https://github.com/mrbbot/miniflare), but may be useful for
other projects too. Many thanks to [@inikulin](https://github.com/inikulin) for
their work on
[lol-html's JavaScript API](https://github.com/cloudflare/lol-html/tree/master/js-api)
which this package's Rust code is based on.

## Usage

```js
import { HTMLRewriter } from "html-rewriter-wasm";

const encoder = new TextEncoder();
const decoder = new TextDecoder();

const rewriter = new HTMLRewriter((outputChunk) => {
  if (outputChunk.length === 0) {
    // Remember to free memory on last chunk
    queueMicrotask(() => rewriter.free());
  } else {
    console.log(decoder.decode(outputChunk)); // <p>new</p>
  }
});

rewriter.on("p", {
  element(element) {
    element.setInnerContent("new");
  },
});

await rewriter.write(encoder.encode("<p>old</p>"));
await rewriter.end();
```

See [test/index.ts](./test/index.ts) for a more traditional `HTMLRewriter`
implementation that doesn't have the caveats listed below, but restricts input
and output to strings.

## Caveats

- `end` may only be called once per `HTMLRewriter` instance. This means you must
  create a new `HTMLRewriter` instance for each transformation:

  ```js
  // ‚ùå
  const rewriter = new HTMLRewriter(...);
  await rewriter.end();
  await rewriter.end(); // not allowed

  // ‚úÖ
  const rewriter1 = new HTMLRewriter(...);
  await rewriter1.end();
  const rewriter2 = new HTMLRewriter(...);
  await rewriter2.end();
  ```

- When using `async` handlers, you must always `await` calls to `write` and
  `end` before calling them again. In other words, you cannot have concurrent
  `write` and `end` calls:

  ```js
  const rewriter = new HTMLRewriter(...).on("p", {
    async element(element) {
      await fetch(...);
      element.setInnerContent("new");
    }
  });

  // ‚ùå
  rewriter.write(encoder.encode("<p>1</p>"));
  rewriter.write(encoder.encode("<p>2</p>")); // not allowed

  // ‚ùå
  const promise1 = rewriter.write(encoder.encode("<p>1</p>"));
  const promise2 = rewriter.write(encoder.encode("<p>2</p>"));
  await Promise.all([promise1, promise2]); // not allowed

  // ‚úÖ
  await rewriter.write(encoder.encode("<p>1</p>"));
  await rewriter.write(encoder.encode("<p>2</p>"));
  ```

- If using handler classes, you must bind their methods to the class first:

  ```js
  class Handler {
    constructor(value) {
      this.value = value;
    }

    element(element) {
      element.setInnerContent(this.value);
    }
  }
  const rewriter = new HTMLRewriter(...);
  const handler = new Handler("new");

  // ‚ùå
  rewriter.on("p", handler);

  // ‚úÖ
  rewriter.on("p", {
    element: handler.element.bind(handler)
  })
  ```

## Building

You can build the package by running `npm run build`. You must do this prior to
running tests with `npm test`. You **must** have mrbbot's fork of wasm-pack
installed. This upgrades binaryen (wasm-opt) to version_92 which exports
`asyncify_get_state`.
